### SecureCommunications
Open-source project managed by two individuals that aims to create a platform for secure, private and decentralized communications.
Plans are to make this project hybrid in a sense that one can directly communicate with someone else in a P2P manner, or talk to a group of individuals in a self-hosted server, all with public-private key end-to-end encryption.

### Todo

- [ ] Server support for multiple individuals, message relaying, public-private key encryption between different server members, end-to-end encryption.
- [ ] Ability for server to store and save messages using SQLite.
- [ ] Rename project to something more creative.
- [ ] Channels, different servers at once, permissions.
- [ ] Chat commands, ability to integrate applications / 'bots'.
- [ ] Additional utilities to assist with general usability, notifications, sounds, etc.
- [ ] Reworked CLI UI, utilizing react-blessed.

### In Progress

- [ ] Ability for the client and server to generate their own private and public keys, if needed.
- [ ] Ability for client to verify server 'identity' via the server's public key.

### Done âœ“

- [x] Theorize the workings of the project.
- [x] Implement basic user input.
