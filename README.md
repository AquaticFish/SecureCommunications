### SecureCommunications
Open-source project managed by two individuals that aims to create a platform for secure, private and decentralized communications.
Plans are to make this project hybrid in a sense that one can directly communicate with someone else in a P2P manner, or talk to a group of individuals in a self-hosted server, all with public-private key end-to-end encryption.

### Todo

- [ ] Ability for client to verify server 'identity' via the server's public key.
- [ ] Ability for the client and server to generate their own private and public keys, if needed.
- [ ] Server support for multiple individuals, message relaying, public-private key encryption between different server members, end-to-end encryption.
- [ ] (Maybe) chat commands.
- [ ] Ability for server to store and save messages.
- [ ] Rename project to something more creative.
- [ ] Additional utilities: message notifications and more.
- [ ] Upgraded / reworked UI, ability to be able to access multiple servers at once, possibly an electron or react based UI, or a greatly expanded CLI one.

### In Progress

- [ ] Websockets. Ability for client to communicate with server.

### Done âœ“

- [x] Theorize the workings of the project.
- [x] Implement basic user input.
